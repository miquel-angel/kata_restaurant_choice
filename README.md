We need an app that helps us decide which's the best restaurant to go to.

As input, the app receives a list of restaurants associated with some keywords, like "Chinese, Thai", "Pizza, Kevab".
The other input you receive is what the users have decided.
This decision comes with N positive keywords and M negative keywords.
Finally receive also the user that is the organizer.
The restaurant with the most votes, according to the keywords, gets elected, if draw, the restaurant with most votes that
comes from the organizer(of the restaurants with most votes of course), will be elected, and the last criteria to obtain the best,
if all of the previous are in draw, is the first alphabetical.

Positive keywords add +1 to the restaurant. Negative keywords sustract 1.

You can assume that the users will always choose keywords that exists in the restaurants. Don't need to check for that.
